Intelligent Caching Strategy\n\nSection Content:\n# Building an Intelligent Document Generator: From Raw Content to Polished PDFs and Presentations\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn today's knowledge economy, organizations face the critical challenge of managing content that is ubiquitous but rarely in the correct format. Teams frequently handle scattered knowledge across various file types, including PDFs, slide decks, markdown files, web articles, and Word documents. This leads to significant time spent on manual conversion and reformatting for different audiences, resulting in inconsistent presentation quality and a lack of a unified visual language. Important information often remains buried in poorly structured files, causing developers and content creators to waste 20-30% of their time on document formatting. A typical scenario might involve a technical team spending 8-12 hours manually consolidating 15 architectural PDFs into a single presentation for stakeholders. An automated solution can accomplish this same task in approximately 5 minutes. The goal is not merely to save time, but to democratize professional content creation, allowing teams to focus on the value of their ideas rather than the mechanics of formatting.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\n### 1.1 The Challenge of Content Formatting\n\nA primary challenge for modern organizations is that while content is abundant, it is rarely in the appropriate format for its intended use. Knowledge is often scattered across a wide array of document types, such as PDFs, slide decks, markdown files, and web articles. This fragmentation necessitates extensive manual conversion efforts, where teams spend hours reformatting content to suit different audiences. The consequences include inconsistent presentation styles across the organization, lost context due to poorly structured files, and significant time waste. Professionals can spend up to 20-30% of their work time just on document formatting tasks, detracting from core responsibilities.\n\n### 1.2 The Value of Automated Generation\n\nAutomat",
  "response": "To enhance performance, our intelligent caching strategy employs a three-layer system to process incoming requests efficiently. The system checks for data sequentially, starting with an API request cache, followed by a structured content cache, and finally an image cache. A successful \"cache hit\" at any layer delivers a fast response, saving time and cost, while only a complete miss requires retrieving data from the origin database.",
