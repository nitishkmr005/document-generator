Future Improvements and Roadmap\nSection Content:\nThe future development of the document generator is planned across four phases, focusing on enhancing intelligence, adding enterprise features, and expanding the platform's capabilities.\n\n### 9.1 Phase 1: Enhanced Intelligence (Q1 2026)\n\nThis phase focuses on expanding input capabilities and improving visual generation. Key features include support for multi-modal inputs like audio transcription and video frame analysis, advanced image generation with diagram type detection and custom branding, and a collaborative editing feature with a real-time preview.\n\n### 9.2 Phase 2: Enterprise Features (Q2 2026)\n\nThe second phase will introduce features tailored for enterprise use. This includes a template system for custom PDF/PPTX layouts with brand kit integration, a distributed cache using Redis, semantic similarity matching for content reuse, and a batch processing system with a progress tracking dashboard.\n\n### 9.3 Phase 3: AI Enhancements (Q3 2026)\n\nPhase three will integrate more advanced AI capabilities. Planned features include intelligent content analysis for fact-checking and citation extraction, personalization options to tailor content for specific audiences and reading levels, and the ability to generate interactive documents with embedded quizzes and clickable diagrams.\n\n### 9.4 Phase 4: Platform Expansion (Q4 2026)\n\nThe final planned phase will broaden the platform's reach. This involves adding support for more output formats like HTML, EPUB, and LaTeX; building an integration ecosystem with connectors for Slack, Google Drive, Zapier, and Make.com; and introducing an analytics dashboard for tracking document engagement and content effectiveness.\n\nRules:\n- If an image is NOT needed, return exactly: none\n- If an image IS needed, return a single concise image prompt.\n- Use ONLY concepts present in the content.\n- Do NOT add new facts, tools, or labels.\n- The prompt should describe what to depict clearly.\n",
