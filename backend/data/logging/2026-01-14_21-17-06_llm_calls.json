Teams deal with:\n\n- \ud83d\udcc4 **Scattered knowledge**: PDFs, slide decks, markdown files, web articles, Word documents\n- \ud83d\udd04 **Manual conversion**: Hours spent reformatting content for different audiences\n- \ud83c\udfa8 **Inconsistent presentation**: No unified visual language across documents\n- \ud83d\udcca **Lost context**: Important information buried in poorly structured files\n- \u23f0 **Time waste**: Developers and content creators spending 20-30% of their time on document formatting\n\n### The Real Cost\n\nConsider a typical scenario:\n\n- A technical team has 15 PDFs documenting their architecture\n- They need to create a unified presentation for stakeholders\n- Manual process: 8-12 hours of copy-paste, reformatting, and image creation\n- **Our solution: 5 minutes of automated processing**\n\nThis isn't just about saving time\u2014it's about **democratizing professional content creation** and letting teams focus on what matters: the ideas, not the formatting.\n\n---\n\n## Business Value & Use Cases\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Primary Use Cases\n\n#### 1. **Technical Documentation Consolidation**\n\n**Problem**: Engineering teams have documentation scattered across PDF...[truncated]",
