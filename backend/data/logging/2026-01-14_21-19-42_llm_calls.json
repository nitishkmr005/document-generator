  "prompt": "Create a vibrant, educational infographic that explains: A side-by-side comparison showing two scenes. On one side, a chaotic and manual process where a person struggles to reformat scattered document types like PDFs and slide decks into a single presentation. On the other side, a clean, automated process effortlessly transforming those same documents into one unified, professional presentation.\n\nStyle requirements:\n- Clean, modern infographic design\n- Use clear icons only when they represent actual concepts\n- Include clear labels and annotations\n- Use a professional color palette (blues, teals, oranges)\n- Make it suitable for inclusion in a professional document\n- No text-heavy design - focus on visual explanation\n- High contrast for readability when printed\n- Use ONLY the concepts in the prompt; do not add new information\n- Avoid metaphorical objects (pipes, ropes, factories) unless explicitly mentioned\n- For workflows/architectures, use flat rounded rectangles + arrows in a clean grid\n- Target size: 1024x768px",
