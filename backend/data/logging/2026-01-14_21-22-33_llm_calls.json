The client sends a POST request to `/api/generate`, including the `file_id` and an API key in the header. 3. The server streams real-time progress updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE). 4. The client sends a GET request to `/api/download` to retrieve the final file.\n\nStyle requirements:\n- Clean, modern infographic design\n- Use clear icons only when they represent actual concepts\n- Include clear labels and annotations\n- Use a professional color palette (blues, teals, oranges)\n- Make it suitable for inclusion in a professional document\n- No text-heavy design - focus on visual explanation\n- High contrast for readability when printed\n- Use ONLY the concepts in the prompt; do not add new information\n- Avoid metaphorical objects (pipes, ropes, factories) unless explicitly mentioned\n- For workflows/architectures, use flat rounded rectangles + arrows in a clean grid\n- Target size: 1024x768px",
