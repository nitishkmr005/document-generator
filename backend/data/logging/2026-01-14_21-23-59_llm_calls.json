  "prompt": "Decide whether this section needs an image.\n\nSection Title: Key Takeaways\nSection Content:\nThe document generator is built on four core principles: prioritizing fidelity over creativity by restructuring rather than reinventing content; favoring caching over computation to reuse results whenever possible; relying on observability over guesswork by measuring all aspects of the system; and ensuring flexibility over lock-in through a multi-provider, multi-format architecture. For teams, the impact is significant, saving over 500 hours per year on document formatting, reducing costs by an estimated $25,000-$50,000, ensuring consistent quality, and enabling faster decision-making with instant summaries.\n\nRules:\n- If an image is NOT needed, return exactly: none\n- If an image IS needed, return a single concise image prompt.\n- Use ONLY concepts present in the content.\n- Do NOT add new facts, tools, or labels.\n- The prompt should describe what to depict clearly.\n",
  "response": "A four-part visual where each part connects a core principle to a key benefit. The principles are fidelity, caching, observability, and flexibility. The benefits are saved hours, reduced costs, consistent quality, and faster decision-making.",
