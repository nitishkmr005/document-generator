The diagram shows the following sequential nodes: detecting format, parsing content, transforming content, enhancing content, generating images, describing images, persisting an image manifest, generating the final output, and validating that output. The flowchart includes a retry mechanism for failed steps.\n\nStyle requirements:\n- Clean, modern infographic design\n- Use clear icons only when they represent actual concepts\n- Include clear labels and annotations\n- Use a professional color palette (blues, teals, oranges)\n- Make it suitable for inclusion in a professional document\n- No text-heavy design - focus on visual explanation\n- High contrast for readability when printed\n- Use ONLY the concepts in the prompt; do not add new information\n- Avoid metaphorical objects (pipes, ropes, factories) unless explicitly mentioned\n- For workflows/architectures, use flat rounded rectangles + arrows in a clean grid\n- Target size: 1024x768px",
