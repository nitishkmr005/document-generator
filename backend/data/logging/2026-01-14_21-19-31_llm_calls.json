  "prompt": "Decide whether this section needs an image.\n\nSection Title: 1. Introduction\nSection Content:\n### 1.1 The Challenge of Content Formatting\n\nA primary challenge for modern organizations is that while content is abundant, it is rarely in the appropriate format for its intended use. Knowledge is often scattered across a wide array of document types, such as PDFs, slide decks, markdown files, and web articles. This fragmentation necessitates extensive manual conversion efforts, where teams spend hours reformatting content to suit different audiences. The consequences include inconsistent presentation styles across the organization, lost context due to poorly structured files, and significant time waste. Professionals can spend up to 20-30% of their work time just on document formatting tasks, detracting from core responsibilities.\n\n### 1.2 The Value of Automated Generation\n\nAutomated document generation provides a clear solution to the costs associated with manual formatting. For instance, a technical team needing to create a unified stakeholder presentation from 15 separate architecture PDFs would typically spend 8 to 12 hours on the manual process of copying, pasting, and reformatting. An intelligent, automated system can reduce this workload to just five minutes. This efficiency gain is about more than just saving time; it empowers teams by democratizing the creation of professional content. It allows them to concentrate on the substance of their ideas and information, rather than the tedious and time-consuming task of formatting.\n\nRules:\n- If an image is NOT needed, return exactly: none\n- If an image IS needed, return a single concise image prompt.\n- Use ONLY concepts present in the content.\n- Do NOT add new facts, tools, or labels.\n- The prompt should describe what to depict clearly.\n",
  "response": "A side-by-side comparison showing two scenes. On one side, a chaotic and manual process where a person struggles to reformat scattered document types like PDFs and slide decks into a single presentation. On the other side, a clean, automated process effortlessly transforming those same documents into one unified, professional presentation.",
