  "prompt": "Decide whether this section needs an image.\n\nSection Title: Introduction\nSection Content:\nIn today's knowledge economy, organizations face the critical challenge of managing content that is ubiquitous but rarely in the correct format. Teams frequently handle scattered knowledge across various file types, including PDFs, slide decks, markdown files, web articles, and Word documents. This leads to significant time spent on manual conversion and reformatting for different audiences, resulting in inconsistent presentation quality and a lack of a unified visual language. Important information often remains buried in poorly structured files, causing developers and content creators to waste 20-30% of their time on document formatting. A typical scenario might involve a technical team spending 8-12 hours manually consolidating 15 architectural PDFs into a single presentation for stakeholders. An automated solution can accomplish this same task in approximately 5 minutes. The goal is not merely to save time, but to democratize professional content creation, allowing teams to focus on the value of their ideas rather than the mechanics of formatting.\n\nRules:\n- If an image is NOT needed, return exactly: none\n- If an image IS needed, return a single concise image prompt.\n- Use ONLY concepts present in the content.\n- Do NOT add new facts, tools, or labels.\n- The prompt should describe what to depict clearly.\n",
