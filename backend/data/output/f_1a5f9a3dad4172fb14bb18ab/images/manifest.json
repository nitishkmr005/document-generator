    "1": "This image illustrates the challenge of content formatting, contrasting a manual versus an automated process for document unification. The manual approach is chaotic and time-consuming, showing a person struggling to consolidate various scattered file types like PDFs, spreadsheets, and slide decks. In contrast, the automated process is seamless and efficient, using an AI processor to convert these disparate inputs into a single, unified presentation.",
    "2": "This framework illustrates key business use cases, demonstrating how scattered content can be automatically transformed into valuable, polished documents. The system processes diverse inputs like PDFs, research papers, and meeting notes to produce unified reports, professional slide decks, and actionable summaries. By automating tedious reformatting and structuring, teams can save significant time and focus on the value of their ideas rather than manual document creation.",
    "3": "This diagram outlines our LLM application's layered architecture, designed for a clear separation of concerns. At the top, a FastAPI-powered API Layer serves as the entry point, receiving and routing requests. The core logic resides in the Application Layer, which uses LangGraph to orchestrate tasks by interacting with the underlying Domain, Infrastructure, and External API layers.",
    "4": "This diagram illustrates the LangGraph Generation Workflow, a resilient, multi-step process for intelligently creating documents. The system begins by parsing raw content and then branches into parallel paths to transform text and generate images. Featuring built-in retry mechanisms for each step, the workflow converges to generate and validate a polished final output.",
    "5": "At the core of our intelligent document generator is a multi-provider LLM strategy optimized for cost, capability, and redundancy. A central orchestration system receives user requests and intelligently routes them to the most suitable model—Gemini for cost-optimized tasks, Claude for advanced reasoning, or OpenAI for diverse capabilities and redundancy. This architecture ensures we can efficiently handle complex requests by aggregating the outputs into a single, polished response.",
    "6": "To enhance performance, our intelligent caching strategy employs a three-layer system to process incoming requests efficiently. The system checks for data sequentially, starting with an API request cache, followed by a structured content cache, and finally an image cache. A successful \"cache hit\" at any layer delivers a fast response, saving time and cost, while only a complete miss requires retrieving data from the origin database.",
    "7": "This sequence diagram illustrates our asynchronous API workflow for processing files. A client first uploads a file to get a unique ID, then sends a separate request to trigger the generation process. While the back-end services handle the file, the client can receive real-time progress updates, and once complete, the final document is retrieved via a download endpoint.",
    "8": "Our production system architecture is built for security, performance, and reliability. The data flow for user requests begins with a multi-stage Docker deployment, then moves through a security layer that handles input and parallel processing. Performance is then tuned with sandboxing and lazy loading, while an observability dashboard provides a continuous feedback loop by monitoring key metrics like latency and error rates.",
    "9": "Our 2026 Product Development Roadmap provides a visual blueprint for future innovation, laying out a clear four-phase plan. The journey begins with enhancing intelligence and building out enterprise features. It then progresses to integrating advanced AI enhancements like Natural Language Processing before culminating in a major platform expansion.",
    "11": "This infographic highlights core software principles that optimize development and operations for an intelligent document generator. By focusing on fidelity, the system ensures consistent quality, directly addressing the challenge of reformatting content from scattered sources. This approach, combined with principles like caching and observability, leads to tangible business benefits such as faster decision-making and reduced costs."
