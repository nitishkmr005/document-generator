| [patterns.md](./patterns.md) | Recurring patterns for future MVPs |

## Creating a Retro

Use the `/retro` skill or create manually:

```markdown
# Retro: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
What milestone/session was this for?

## What Went Well
-

## What Went Poorly
-

## What We Learned
-

## Action Items
-
```

## Patterns

The [patterns.md](./patterns.md) file captures recurring insights that should carry forward to future MVP projects. Update this when you notice:

- A technique that worked well multiple times
- A mistake you want to avoid repeating
- A workflow improvement worth preserving

## Skills

- `/retro` - Create a new retrospective
- `/session-end` - Updates status and optionally creates retro
